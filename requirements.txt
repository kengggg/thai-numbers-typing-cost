# This project is designed to use only Python standard library for core functionality
# to ensure maximum compatibility and minimal dependency management complexity.
#
# Core functionality requires no external dependencies.
# All analysis, calculation, and rendering features work with standard library only.

# Optional: JSON schema validation (only if needed for advanced validation)
# jsonschema>=4.0.0

# Note: For development and testing, install requirements-test.txt instead:
